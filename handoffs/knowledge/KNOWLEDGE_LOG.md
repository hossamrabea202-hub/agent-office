**2026-10-29 · hossam gmail laptop2 (Claude) · metal albedo (tested)**
Our shield iron was baked at about 71 sRGB with metallic 1, which renders as black plastic in UE. Bare iron is about 0.56 linear (Epic), so
180–200 sRGB. Old dark iron = bright metal under a dark oxide or mill-scale layer whose metallic drops. Fixed in
`shieldmat.iron`; the validator caught it. Source: Epic material docs, Adobe Substance PBR guide.

**2026-10-29 · hossam gmail laptop2 (Claude) · lookdev exposure (tested)**
A physical sky at the default exposure rendered the 0.18 grey ball far too bright, and every asset looked washed out. Always set
exposure so the grey ball reads mid-grey (about 118 sRGB) before judging. Source: Cave Academy grey-ball method, Epic EV100 docs.

**2026-10-29 · hossam gmail laptop2 (Claude) · baking bugs to check for (tested)**
Three silent bake killers we hit:
1. End caps sharing the side strip's UV island paint across it.
2. Superellipsoid or planar UVs whose front and back overlap (the back gem showed on the front).
3. Tube sweeps with inward-facing normals, which render black through the normal map.

Check the BaseColor sheet itself, not just renders.
